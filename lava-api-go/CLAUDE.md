# CLAUDE.md — lava-api-go

Agent-facing guide for working in this module.

## Inherited rules (non-negotiable)
See `CONSTITUTION.md`. Sixth Law, Local-Only CI/CD, Decoupled Reusable Architecture.

## Tech stack
- Go 1.24+
- Gin Gonic, quic-go v0.59 (via `digital.vasic.http3`), pgx/v5
- Tests: stdlib `testing`, real Postgres in podman, real HTTP/3 client
- Local CI: `scripts/ci.sh` (no hosted CI ever)

## Layout
- `api/openapi.yaml` — D1 spec-first, source of truth.
- `internal/gen/{server,client}/` — committed `oapi-codegen` output. CI enforces "regenerate produces empty diff".
- `internal/{auth,handlers,rutracker}/` and `cmd/healthprobe/` — Lava-domain code.
- `internal/{cache,config,discovery,observability,ratelimit,server}/` — thin glue around vasic-digital submodules.
- `migrations/` — golang-migrate SQL files; applied by the one-shot `lava-migrate` compose service.
- `tests/{contract,e2e,parity,load,fixtures}/` — the higher test types per spec §11.

## When changing public API
The OpenAPI spec is the contract. Modify `api/openapi.yaml` first, regenerate, then update handlers. The cross-backend parity test will fail if the spec diverges from the Ktor proxy's wire shape — that's the protection.

## Falsifiability protocol (Sixth Law clause 2)
Every PR adding or modifying a test MUST record in its commit body:
- `Test:` the test name + file
- `Mutation:` the deliberate production-code change
- `Observed:` the exact assertion message that fired
- `Reverted:` confirmation that the final commit reflects unmutated code

## SP-3a-bridge expectations (added 2026-04-30)

When SP-2 ships its last release tag, the SP-3a-bridge follow-up plan
will refactor the Go-side rutracker handlers to mirror the Kotlin-side
multi-tracker SDK. That work is not yet planned in detail; this clause
makes the constitutional binding explicit now so the Go-side work
cannot drift from the Anti-Bluff Pact established on the Android side.

Specifically:

- **Clause 6.D (Behavioral Coverage Contract) binds the Go-side
  rutracker refactor.** Every public method of every Go interface
  added to bridge to the Kotlin SDK shape (e.g. a Go `tracker.Client`
  contract) MUST have at least one real-stack test traversing the
  same code path a real client request would trigger. The
  `tests/contract/`, `tests/e2e/`, and `tests/parity/` directories
  already enforce this for current handlers; the bridge work extends
  it. Coverage exemptions go to `docs/superpowers/specs/<bridge-spec>-
  coverage-exemptions.md`.

- **Clause 6.E (Capability Honesty) binds the Go-side tracker
  registry.** When the Go server learns to advertise multiple
  trackers (rutracker + rutor), every capability declared by a Go
  `TrackerDescriptor` MUST resolve to a real handler — no "501 Not
  Implemented" stubs behind a declared capability. The cross-backend
  parity test in `tests/parity/` is the mechanical gate.

- **Clause 6.F (Anti-Bluff Submodule Inheritance).** Every
  vasic-digital submodule pulled in by lava-api-go inherits 6.A-6.E
  recursively. Adopting an externally maintained dependency that
  does not satisfy these clauses requires forking it under
  vasic-digital/ first. The Seventh Law (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)
  inherits under the same rule; the Bluff-Audit commit-message stamp
  applies verbatim to every Go test commit (`*_test.go`).

The bridge plan lives at `docs/superpowers/plans/<TBD-after-SP-2>.md`
once written. Until then, no Go-side work that touches the bridge
shape is in scope; SP-3a Phases 0-5 explicitly exclude Go changes.

## Clauses 6.G and 6.H (added 2026-05-04)

- **Clause 6.G (End-to-End Provider Operational Verification).**
  Today this module exposes only the rutracker handlers. The
  user-facing surface IS the HTTP API itself, so 6.G binds at the
  endpoint level: every endpoint advertised by `api/openapi.yaml`
  MUST have a real-stack test that confirms a real client can
  complete the flow end-to-end (real Gin engine, real Postgres in
  podman, real upstream tracker over the network where applicable).
  An endpoint declared in the spec but unable to complete its flow
  against the real stack is a constitutional violation, irrespective
  of unit-test coverage. Becomes load-bearing on any future
  multi-tracker bridge.

- **Clause 6.H (Credential Security Inviolability).** No tracker
  username, password, API key, signing key, JWT secret, or database
  credential shall ever appear in any tracked file (`.go`, `.sql`,
  `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.md`, `.sh`, `Makefile`, …). Credentials come
  from a gitignored `.env` or a local secrets manager at runtime.
  The Auth-Token redaction rule (CONSTITUTION §Module-specific
  rules) is necessary but not sufficient — the credential must
  never reach a tracked file in the first place.
  `scripts/check-constitution.sh` enforces this at pre-push;
  introducing a credential pattern fails the push.

## Clauses 6.I and 6.J (added 2026-05-04, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.I — Multi-Emulator Container Matrix as Real-Device Equivalent** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.I. Real-stack verification, where this service's work requires it (per 6.G clause 5 / Sixth Law clause 5 / Seventh Law clause 3), is satisfied by: (a) the project's container-bound multi-emulator matrix when the Android client surface is exercised through this service; (b) a real Postgres instance in podman/docker for any persistence-touching path; (c) a real HTTP/3 + HTTP/2 socket via the actual `cmd/lava-api-go` binary for any transport-touching path. Mocks of these boundaries are forbidden as the gating signal. Per-stack attestation rows go in `.lava-ci-evidence/<tag>/real-device-verification.md` (or the Go-side equivalent). A single passing test is NOT the gate.
- **Clause 6.J — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.J. Every test, every contract test, and every CI gate touched by this service MUST do exactly one job: confirm the feature it claims to cover actually works for an end user, end-to-end, on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, never sufficient. Adding a test the author cannot execute against the real Postgres + real HTTP stack (or against the emulator container path where applicable) is itself a bluff. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre.

## Clauses 6.K and 6.L (added 2026-05-04, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.K — Builds-Inside-Containers Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.K. Every release-artifact build of this service MUST run inside the project's container-bound build path, anchored on `vasic-digital/Containers`'s build orchestration (`cmd/distributed-build` + `pkg/distribution` + `pkg/runtime`), not on the developer's bare host. Specifically: the `lava-api-go` static binary build (`cmd/lava-api-go`, `cmd/healthprobe`, `cmd/lava-migrate`) and the OCI image build (multi-stage `Dockerfile`) MUST go through Containers' build orchestration when producing a release artifact, when the output is signed, or when the output is consumed by the emulator-matrix gate. The existing `Makefile` targets (`make build`, `make image`, `make ci`) and the `Dockerfile` path become **thin Lava-side glue** invoking the Containers primitives — they remain in this service for iteration convenience but the gate path goes through Containers. Local incremental dev builds (`go build ./...`, `go test ./...` against the host toolchain) are PERMITTED for fast iteration; the constitutional gate is not. Per the 6.K-debt entry, until `Submodules/Containers/pkg/emulator/` and `Submodules/Containers/pkg/vm/` ship, the existing Makefile + Dockerfile + `scripts/ci.sh` continue to function as transitional glue; the next phase that touches release tagging MUST close 6.K-debt for this service before its tag. An `lava-api-go` binary built outside the container path and tested inside a clause-6.I container path is constitutionally suspect — green contract/parity/e2e tests against a binary the gate did not build are a bluff vector by construction.
- **Clause 6.L — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate (Operator's Standing Order)** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.L. Restated verbatim from 6.J because the operator has invoked this mandate TWENTY-SEVEN TIMES across multiple working days (27th: 2026-05-14 Lava-Android-1.2.20-1040 debug install on Galaxy S23 Ultra surfaced two non-crashing defects all existing tests had passed against — birthed §6.AB Anti-Bluff Test-Suite Reinforcement); the repetition itself is the forensic record. Every test, every contract test, every parity test, every e2e test, every CI gate has exactly one job: confirm the feature works for a real user end-to-end on the gating matrix (real Gin engine, real Postgres in podman, real HTTP/3 + HTTP/2 socket, and where applicable the emulator-container path for the Android-client-facing surface). CI green is necessary, never sufficient. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre. If you find yourself rationalizing a "small exception" — STOP. There are no small exceptions. The Internet Archive stuck-on-loading bug, the broken post-login navigation, the credential leak in C2, the bluffed C1-C8 — these are what "small exceptions" produce. The 16th invocation (2026-05-12, after the C03 + Cloudflare-mitigation commits `4d27c07`+`f7d0a62` landed on master): "Make sure that all existing tests and Challenges do work in anti-bluff manner - they MUST confirm that all tested codebase really works as expected!"

## Clause 6.M (added 2026-05-04 evening, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.M — Host-Stability Forensic Discipline** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.M. Every perceived-instability event during a session that touches this service MUST be classified into Class I (verifiable host event), Class II (resource pressure), or Class III (operator-perceived without forensic evidence) AND audited via the 7-step forensic protocol (uptime+who, journalctl logind events, kernel critical events, free -h, df -h, forbidden-command grep across tracked files, container state inventory). Findings recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/sixth-law-incidents/<date>-<slug>.json`. **Container-runtime safety analysis (recorded once in root §6.M, referenced forever):** rootless Podman has NO host-level power-management privileges; rootful Docker is not installed on the operator's primary host. The `lava-api-go` container — whether running locally via `make run-container` or in podman-compose — is a session-scoped service and cannot cause Class I host events. The container's Postgres dependency, image-export step in `make image`, and integration-test database lifecycle are all session-scoped operations. A perceived-instability event during a test run touching this service without an audit record is itself a Seventh Law violation under clause 6.J ("tests must guarantee the product works" — applied recursively to incident response). When this service is run standalone (without Lava in the parent dir), incidents are recorded at `lava-api-go/.evidence/host-stability/<date>.json` with cross-reference to the consuming Lava project's `.lava-ci-evidence/sixth-law-incidents/` if the session also exercised Lava code paths.

## Clause 6.N (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.N — Bluff-Hunt Cadence Tightening + Production Code Coverage** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.N. Beyond the 2-4 week phase-end baseline, bluff hunts fire IN-cycle on three triggers: (1) per operator anti-bluff-mandate invocation (first/day full 5+2, subsequent same-day lighter 1-2 file incident-response), (2) per matrix-runner/gate change (pre-push enforced via §6.N-debt — owed), (3) per phase-gating attestation file added (pre-push enforced via §6.N-debt — owed). Bluff hunts MUST sample production code (2 files per phase from gate-shaping code + 0-2 from broader CI-touched code) using the conceptual filter "would a bug here be invisible to existing tests?". For this service specifically: gate-shaping code includes `tests/contract/`, `tests/parity/`, `tests/integration/` plus the production handlers they cover. The next phase that touches `scripts/check-constitution.sh` MUST close 6.N-debt by implementing the pre-push hook enforcement.

## Clause 6.O (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.O — Crashlytics-Resolved Issue Coverage Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.O. Every Crashlytics-recorded issue (fatal OR non-fatal) closed/resolved by any commit MUST gain (a) a validation test in the language of the crashing surface that reproduces the conditions, (b) a Challenge Test under `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/lava/app/challenges/` (client) or `tests/e2e/` (server) that drives the same user-facing path, and (c) a closure log at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/<date>-<slug>.md` recording the issue ID, root-cause analysis, fix commit SHA, and links to the tests. `scripts/tag.sh` MUST refuse release tags whose CHANGELOG mentions Crashlytics fixes without matching closure logs. Marking a Crashlytics issue "closed" in the Console requires the test coverage to land first — never close-mark before the regression-immunity tests exist. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05, 2 Crashlytics-recorded crashes within minutes of the first Firebase-instrumented APK distribution (Lava-Android-1.2.3-1023, commit `e9de508`); post-mortem at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-firebase-init-hardening.md`. The operator's ELEVENTH §6.L invocation made this clause load-bearing.

## Clause 6.P (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.P — Distribution Versioning + Changelog Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.P. Every distribute action (Firebase App Distribution, container registry pushes, releases/ snapshots, scripts/tag.sh) MUST: (1) carry a strictly increasing versionCode (no re-distribution of already-published codes); (2) include a CHANGELOG entry — canonical file `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root + per-version snapshot at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>.md`; (3) inject the changelog into the App Distribution release-notes via `--release-notes`. `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` REFUSES to operate when current versionCode ≤ last-distributed versionCode for the channel, OR when CHANGELOG.md lacks an entry for the current version, OR when the per-version snapshot file is missing. `scripts/tag.sh` enforces the same gates pre-tag. Re-distributing the same versionCode is forbidden across distribute sessions; idempotent retry within a single session is permitted. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:11 operator's TWELFTH §6.L invocation: "when distributing new build it must have version code bigger by at least one then the last version code available for download (already distribited). Every distributed build MUST CONTAIN changelog with the details what it includes compared to previous one we have published!"

## Clause 6.Q (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.Q — Compose Layout Antipattern Guard** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Q. Forbids nesting vertically-scrolling lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyVerticalGrid, LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid) inside parents giving unbounded vertical space (verticalScroll, unbounded wrapContentHeight, LinearLayout-with-weight wrapper). Equivalent rule horizontally for LazyRow / LazyHorizontalGrid / LazyHorizontalStaggeredGrid. Per-feature structural tests + Compose UI Challenge Tests on the §6.I matrix are the load-bearing acceptance gates. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:51 operator-reported "Opening Trackers from Settings crashes the app" — TrackerSelectorList used LazyColumn nested in TrackerSettingsScreen's Column(verticalScroll). Closure log: `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-tracker-settings-nested-scroll.md`. Pattern guard: `feature/tracker_settings/src/test/.../TrackerSelectorListLazyColumnRegressionTest.kt`. The operator THIRTEENTH §6.L invocation triggered this clause.


## Clause 6.S (added 2026-05-06, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.S — Continuation Document Maintenance Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.S. The file `docs/CONTINUATION.md` (in the parent Lava repo) is the single-file source-of-truth handoff document for resuming work across any CLI session. Every commit affecting this service that changes phase status, lands a new spec/plan, bumps a pin, ships a release artifact (binary, image, container deployment), discovers/resolves a known issue, or implements an operator scope directive MUST update `docs/CONTINUATION.md` in the SAME COMMIT. The §0 "Last updated" line MUST track HEAD. Stale CONTINUATION.md is itself a §6.J spirit issue under §6.L's repeated mandate.

## Clause 6.R (added 2026-05-06, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.R — No-Hardcoding Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.R. No connection address, port, header field name, credential, key, salt, secret, schedule, algorithm parameter, or domain literal shall appear as a string/int constant in tracked source code under `lava-api-go/`. Every such value MUST come from `.env` (gitignored), generated config class, runtime env var, or mounted file. Go API service MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## Clause 6.T — Universal Quality Constraints (added 2026-05-06, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.T — Universal Quality Constraints** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.T. All four sub-points (Reproduction-Before-Fix, Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges, No-Force-Push, Bugfix Documentation) apply verbatim to every commit in `lava-api-go/`. The Go API service MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax any of §6.T.1–§6.T.4.

## §6.X — Container-Submodule Emulator Wiring Mandate (inherited 2026-05-13, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.X. Every Android emulator instance the project depends on for testing MUST execute its emulator process INSIDE a podman/docker container managed by `Submodules/Containers/`, NOT be host-direct-launched by Containers-submodule code that runs on the host. The Containers submodule's `pkg/runtime/` (rootless podman/docker auto-detection) brings the container up; `pkg/emulator/` orchestrates the AVD lifecycle inside it. Lava-side `scripts/run-emulator-tests.sh` is thin glue forwarding to the Containers CLI. The container-bound path is the gate — host-direct emulators are permitted for workstation iteration only. §6.X-debt tracks the wiring implementation owed to `Submodules/Containers/`. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.Y — Post-Distribution Version Bump Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Y. After every successful distribution of any artifact (Android APK via Firebase App Distribution, Google Play Store release, container image push, **lava-api-go binary release**, any future distributable artifact), the FIRST commit in the new development cycle that touches code MUST bump the artifact's `versionCode` integer. For lava-api-go specifically: bump `Code` + `Name` constants in `internal/version/version.go`. The `versionName` semver MUST be bumped when the changes warrant a user-visible version change. §6.Y-debt is open: pre-push hook + check-constitution.sh enforcement of bump-first ordering documented but not yet mechanically enforced.

## §6.AC — Comprehensive Non-Fatal Telemetry Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AC. For lava-api-go: every error path MUST call `internal/observability.RecordNonFatal(ctx, err, attrs)`. JVM/host-only assertions are not enough. Mandatory attributes: feature/module, operation, error_class, error_message (no credentials per §6.H), endpoint, request_id, tracker_id where applicable. §6.AC-debt is open. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.AB — Anti-Bluff Test-Suite Reinforcement (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AB. Every test + Challenge MUST be auditable: would this test fail if the user-visible behavior broke in a non-crashing way? Per-feature anti-bluff completeness for lava-api-go: assert response body content + schema (not just status code); assert persisted row content (not just insert call); assert service-on-wire behavior via real client (not just process-up). Defect-driven bluff-hunt + discrimination test per Challenge Test mandatory. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.AA — Two-Stage Distribute Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AA. Two-stage distribute (stage 1: debug/dev only → operator verification → stage 2: release/prod only) MANDATORY when an artifact has both variants. For lava-api-go: dev compose container = stage 1; prod compose container OR push to production registry = stage 2 ONLY AFTER stage-1 verification. §6.AA-debt is open. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.Z — Anti-Bluff Distribute Guard (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Z. No artifact may be distributed UNLESS the corresponding end-to-end tests have been **EXECUTED — not source-compiled, EXECUTED** — against the EXACT artifact about to be distributed, AND have **passed**. For lava-api-go specifically: every test under `tests/contract/`, `tests/e2e/`, `tests/parity/` MUST execute against the actual binary about to be released, with real Postgres in podman; JVM/host-only contract tests are necessary, NEVER sufficient. Pre-distribute test-evidence file required at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>-test-evidence.{md,json}` with matching commit SHA + timestamp within 24h + `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`/`ok` verbatim in captured output. Cold-start verification is the load-bearing canary. §6.Z-debt is open. Forensic anchor: 1.2.19-1039 distribute on Galaxy S23 Ultra (Crashlytics `40a62f97a5c65abb56142b4ca2c37eeb` painterResource layer-list rejection) — agent skipped Compose UI test execution citing the wrong §6.X caveat. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.
