# `scripts/check-constitution.sh` — User Guide

**Last verified:** 2026-05-15 (1.2.23 closure-cycle, §6.AD-debt task #61 backfill)
**Inheritance:** HelixConstitution §11.4.18 (script documentation mandate)

## Overview

Stub doc generated from the script's in-source header comment. See `scripts/check-constitution.sh` for canonical behavior. This stub exists so the `CM-SCRIPT-DOCS-SYNC` pre-push gate (`.githooks/pre-push` Check 9) starts gating modifications to this script.

The script's own header documentation (verbatim):

```
scripts/check-constitution.sh — verify constitutional clauses present.

Per the SP-3a plan Task 5.19. Asserts that the three SP-3a clauses
(6.D, 6.E, 6.F) are present in root CLAUDE.md and that the
Submodules/Tracker-SDK/CLAUDE.md exists. Run from scripts/ci.sh in
every mode.
```

## Usage

See the script's in-source comment block (above) for canonical usage examples.

## Maintenance

When this script is modified, update this document in the same commit (CM-SCRIPT-DOCS-SYNC requires it). Per §11.4.18, the documentation MUST stay in sync with the codebase — no doc may be out of sync with its script.
