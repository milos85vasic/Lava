# `scripts/check-canonical-root-and-upstreams.sh` — User Guide

**Last verified:** 2026-05-15 (constitution-compliance plan Phase 8)
**Inheritance:** HelixConstitution §11.4.35 (Canonical-Root Inheritance Clarity) + §11.4.36 (Mandatory install_upstreams) + §11.4.18 (script docs)

## Overview

Combined verifier for two related HelixConstitution clauses:

### §11.4.35 — Canonical-Root Inheritance Clarity

Three sub-checks:

- **(a)** Consumer's root `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` MUST open with an inheritance pointer (within the first 40 lines): either `## INHERITED FROM constitution/<file>` heading OR Claude Code's `@constitution/<file>` import syntax.
- **(b)** The constitution submodule's three canonical files MUST exist: `constitution/CLAUDE.md`, `constitution/AGENTS.md`, `constitution/Constitution.md`.
- **(c)** The constitution submodule's own `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` MUST NOT carry `## INHERITED FROM` at top level — they ARE the canonical root and must not appear to inherit from elsewhere. **Pattern is allowed inside fenced ```` ``` ```` code blocks** (where it's documentation showing consumers the inheritance pattern).

### §11.4.36 — Mandatory install_upstreams script

Every owned-by-us submodule MUST ship an `install_upstreams` script at one of these locations:

- `<submodule>/install_upstreams.sh`
- `<submodule>/install_upstreams`
- `<submodule>/scripts/install_upstreams.sh`
- `<submodule>/scripts/install_upstreams`
- `<submodule>/Upstreams/install.sh`
- `<submodule>/upstreams/install.sh`

The script is what a freshly-cloned submodule uses to self-provision its own remote topology (per §6.W: github + gitlab minimum for vasic-digital submodules; 4 mirrors for HelixDevelopment-owned submodules).

Per-submodule waivers are supported (`INSTALL_UPSTREAMS_WAIVERS=()` in the scanner) with mandatory rationale. No active waivers in 2026-05-15 baseline.

## Modes

| Flag | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `--strict` (default) | Exit 1 on any violation |
| `--advisory` | Exit 0 even on violation |
| `LAVA_CANONICAL_ROOT_STRICT=0` env | Same as --advisory |

## Usage

```bash
bash scripts/check-canonical-root-and-upstreams.sh                # strict (default)
bash scripts/check-canonical-root-and-upstreams.sh --advisory     # exit 0 even on violation
LAVA_CANONICAL_ROOT_STRICT=0 bash scripts/check-canonical-root-and-upstreams.sh   # env-driven
```

## Hermetic test

`tests/check-constitution/test_canonical_root_and_upstreams.sh` — 6 fixtures:

1. `test_compliant_fixture_passes` — baseline compliant fixture
2. `test_missing_root_pointer_rejected` — root CLAUDE.md without inheritance pointer
3. `test_canonical_self_inheritance_rejected` — canonical root carrying its own `## INHERITED FROM` outside any code block
4. `test_missing_install_upstreams_rejected` — submodule lacking install_upstreams
5. `test_advisory_mode_returns_zero` — advisory swallows exit code
6. `test_canonical_fenced_code_block_pointer_passes` — `## INHERITED FROM` INSIDE a fenced ```` ```markdown ```` block is documentation, not violation (discrimination test for false-positive prevention)

## Known violations (2026-05-15 audit)

§11.4.35 sub-checks all PASS in current Lava tree (after the Phase 8 false-positive fix in §11.4.35.c — the constitution submodule's documentation of the pointer pattern inside a fenced code block is correctly recognized as non-violating).

§11.4.36 — 10 of 16 owned submodules MISSING install_upstreams:

| Submodule | Status |
|---|---|
| Auth | ✓ has install_upstreams |
| Cache | ✓ has install_upstreams |
| Challenges | ✗ MISSING — owed in follow-up |
| Concurrency | ✓ has install_upstreams |
| Config | ✗ MISSING — owed in follow-up |
| Containers | ✗ MISSING — owed in follow-up |
| Database | ✓ has install_upstreams |
| Discovery | ✗ MISSING — owed in follow-up |
| HTTP3 | ✗ MISSING — owed in follow-up |
| Mdns | ✗ MISSING — owed in follow-up |
| Middleware | ✗ MISSING — owed in follow-up |
| Observability | ✓ has install_upstreams |
| RateLimiter | ✗ MISSING — owed in follow-up |
| Recovery | ✗ MISSING — owed in follow-up |
| Security | ✓ has install_upstreams |
| Tracker-SDK | ✗ MISSING — owed in follow-up |

Resolution path: each submodule gains its own install_upstreams.sh in a per-submodule commit. Per-submodule cycle: write script → commit to submodule → push to GitHub + GitLab (per §6.W) → bump pin in parent Lava repo. The parent commit can batch the 10 pin bumps once each submodule has its own install_upstreams.
