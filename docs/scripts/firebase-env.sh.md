# `scripts/firebase-env.sh` — User Guide

**Last verified:** 2026-05-15 (1.2.23 closure-cycle, §6.AD-debt task #61 backfill)
**Inheritance:** HelixConstitution §11.4.18 (script documentation mandate)

## Overview

Stub doc generated from the script's in-source header comment. See `scripts/firebase-env.sh` for canonical behavior. This stub exists so the `CM-SCRIPT-DOCS-SYNC` pre-push gate (`.githooks/pre-push` Check 9) starts gating modifications to this script.

The script's own header documentation (verbatim):

```
scripts/firebase-env.sh — load Firebase config from .env (constitutional 6.H).

Usage:
  # shellcheck source=scripts/firebase-env.sh
  source "$(dirname "$0")/firebase-env.sh"

Exits non-zero if .env is missing or required keys are absent. Does NOT
echo any value (constitutional 6.H, 6.M): the values are sensitive and
this helper is sourced into the caller's environment, never logged.
```

## Usage

See the script's in-source comment block (above) for canonical usage examples.

## Maintenance

When this script is modified, update this document in the same commit (CM-SCRIPT-DOCS-SYNC requires it). Per §11.4.18, the documentation MUST stay in sync with the codebase — no doc may be out of sync with its script.
